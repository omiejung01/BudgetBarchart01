# BudgetBarchart01
This is to test using Excel data with Matplotlib Stacked Barchart
I change the filename and the sheetname to avoid the problem with Thai languages.
.
In my environment, Matplotlib has the problem with Thai data values.
.
Please get your Thai budget data for 2024 fiscal year from:
